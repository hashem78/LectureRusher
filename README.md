fumbling around aws lambda is taking precious time, it isn't as intiuitive as it was made to be.
# 4:00pm
Here's what I did during this time.
    1. Experimented with AWS lambda, even more... but it turns out I need more.
    2. Started an EC2 instance... but that was too overboard.
    3. Ahhhh LightSail what a service. Simple, Elegant, and what I need. So I started an AWS LightSail instance got it loaded with Ubuntu 20.04LTS and setup the evironment
    4. Installed apache2, python and flask and setup a basic website to upload files to the server from anywhere.
    5. Began the actual work of getting the silences detected and cut.
