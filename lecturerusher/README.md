# The idea

###### During those times of turmoil, everything takes more time, whether it be online lectures, meetings or content. What if there was a way to reduce audio to it's bare nesccities whereby only the useful parts are kept and the useless discarded into oblivion? Well here it is. Lecture Rusher utilises a powerful machine learning and artifical intelligence model that KNOWS the best times to cut an audio and the best ways to remove filler and silences, based on great reasearch done by sientists across different engineering fields.
